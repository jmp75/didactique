# All things data set related, exploratory mode

## Lithology data sets

Using ecocloud Explorer, noticed that a National Groundwater Information System was [referenced in](https://data.gov.au/dataset/0ddc1f79-6ed3-4f4f-9195-52cf3eb59127) data.gov.au. Despite its possible lock-in dependence on ArcGIS, giving it a go at downloading to explore. [Posted a comment that I could not unzip the resulting file](http://disq.us/p/1wwja48). Disappointed.

Could open the subset for NSW office of water; however the ESRI dependency is an issue of course. 

I think I will have to request the national dataset via email... [see](http://www.bom.gov.au/water/groundwater/ngis/data.shtml)
