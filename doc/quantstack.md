## Context 

I have been looking for C++ code for handling multidimensional arrays in recent years. TODO include the links I had collected. Primarily this was motivated by needs for [ensemble forecasting](https://github.com/jmp75/streamflow-forecasting-tools-onboard) techniques. I recently came across a set of repositories addressing these needs, and the "feel" of it and design philosophy resonated with me.

## Overview

[xtensor](https://github.com/QuantStack/xtensor) is a C++ library meant for numerical analysis with multi-dimensional array expressions.

Interested in [Voila](https://github.com/QuantStack/voila). Tried `python setup.py develop` leads to `npm unavailable` even if nmp in installed on that windows machine.
