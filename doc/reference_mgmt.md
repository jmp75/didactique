## Reference management software

Mendeley has a new desktop reference manager. Uses "appimage" for *nix platforms. 

Trying to launch as a user, however complains that it needs `--no-sandbox` argument. This works with the latter argument. 

Found https://itsfoss.com/use-appimage-linux/  that mentions `firejail`. Gave a try, interesting, but fails to start, not sure why
