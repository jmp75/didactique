## Purpose

A place to explore options to access a "delphi" library from e.g. Python

* Starting from the [simplest example of adding two integers](https://delphi.fandom.com/wiki/Creating_DLLs)
* Compiling using the [Lazarus IDE](https://www.lazarus-ide.org)
* using CFFI in a simple wrapper.py file

We can call AddInteger. Now on to curlier data types, and in particular reference counting pointers to objects.
