I was giving a test run to the [notebooks for the bomwater python package](https://github.com/csiro-hydroinformatics/bomwater-notebook) and started looking inside the package itself. 

Did a bit of looking at SOS related packages. Found [sos4py](https://github.com/52North/sos4py) and [sos4R](https://github.com/52North/sos4R). The latter appears more mature, then again the former also reuses [OWSLib](https://github.com/geopython/OWSLib) so `sos4py` should indeed be smaller in size.
